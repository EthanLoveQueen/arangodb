Guides
======

These guides provide solutions to common problems when building
applications with Foxx services:

[Running Foxx in a cluster](Cluster.md) and how it is different
from Foxx on a standalone server.

[Using development mode](DevelopmentMode.md) and how it is different
from production mode.

[Using authentication and sessions](Auth.md) to restrict access to
your API and keep track of your users.

[Bundling Node modules](BundledNodeModules.md) to use
third-party libraries in your service.

[Working with collections](Collections.md) without worrying
about name conflicts between your services.

[Using routers](Routing.md) in different ways to keep
your code more organized.

[Writing queries](Queries.md) without exposing your service to
injection attacks when handling untrusted data.

[Testing your services](Testing.md) with a familiar API.

[Linking services together](Dependencies.md) to share code or
data between services in the same database.

[Using Foxx scripts](Scripts.md) to run code outside the
request-response cycle or schedule code to be run at a later date.

[Using Webpack](Webpack.md) to use experimental language features or
even other languages to write your service.

[Exposing your service](Browser.md) to the browser in a safe way.

[Handling files](Files.md) and
[making requests](MakingRequests.md) to other servers.

[Using legacy mode](LegacyMode.md) to run old services
in current versions of ArangoDB.
